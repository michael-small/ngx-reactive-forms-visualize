  <p>
    When working on reactive forms in Angular, a common way to visualize
    reactive forms is by using
    <code>{{ snippet }}</code>
  </p>
  <pre>{{ exampleForm.value | json }}</pre>
</div>

<p>
  This library is about taking that idea of displaying the form's data in
  templates to the next level.
